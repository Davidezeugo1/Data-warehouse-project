## About me:

** Hey friends, I am David Ezeugo. I am just starting my journey into the world of data. This will be my first major data project, and I hope you'll join me for the ride.

* If you can provide any advice or tips to help improve the code or my work as a whole, please feel free to let me know.

## Project goal
* This project aims to provide hands-on experience in the life of a data engineer.

## Here are the Specifications

* Data sources: import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM), which are CSV  files

* Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis

* Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

* Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

* Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics
